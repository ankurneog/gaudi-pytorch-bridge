/*
 * Stream pool note.
 *
 * A HPUStream is an abstraction of an actual synapse Stream on the HPU.
 * HPUStreams are backed by synapse Streams, but they use several pools
 * to minimize the costs associated with creating, retaining,
 * and destroying synapse Streams.
 *
 * There are three pools per device, and a device's pools are lazily created.
 *
 * The first pool contains only the default stream. When the default stream
 * is requested it's returned.
 *
 * The second pool is the "low priority" or "default priority" streams.
 * There are 32 of these streams per device, and when a stream is requested
 * one of these streams is returned round-robin. That is, the first stream
 * requested is at index 0, the second at index 1...to index 31,
 * then index 0 again.
 *
 * This means that if 33 low priority streams are requested, the first and
 * last streams requested are actually the same stream (under the covers)
 * and kernels enqueued on them cannot run concurrently.
 *
 * The third pool is the "high priority" streams. The third pool acts like
 * the second pool except the streams are created with a higher priority.
 *
 * These pools suggest that stream users should prefer many short-lived streams,
 * as the cost of acquiring and releasing streams is effectively zero. If
 * many longer-lived streams are required in performance critical scenarios
 * then the functionality here may need to be extended to allow, for example,
 * "reserving" a subset of the pool so that other streams do not accidentally
 * overlap the performance critical streams.
 *
 * Note: although the notion of "current stream for device" is thread local
 * (every OS thread has a separate current stream, as one might expect),
 * the stream pool is global across all threads; stream 0 is always stream 0
 * no matter which thread you use it on.  Multiple threads can synchronize
 * on the same stream.  Although the HPU documentation is not very clear
 * on the matter, streams are thread safe; e.g., it is safe to enqueue
 * a kernel on the same stream from two different threads.
 *
 * Currently on HPU priority is not supported. all the streams have equal
 * priority
