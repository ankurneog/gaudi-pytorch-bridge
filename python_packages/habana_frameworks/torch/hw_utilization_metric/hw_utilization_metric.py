    Provides a unified interface for tracking hardware utilization metrics.

    This class combines two sets of metrics:
      - HPU utilization (e.g., from HL-SMI), which indicates the average usage of the device.
      - Event synchronization metrics, which reflect the ratio of active event processing
        versus idle waiting times on compute stream.

    Example:
        metrics = HWUtilizationMetrics()
        metrics.start()
        # ... perform workload ...
        usage = metrics.get_usage()
        print(f"HL-SMI Usage: {usage.hl_smi}%")
