    Reinplaces in-placeable operations.
    If there are no uses of a view of the mutated arg after the current node,
    it is possible to inplace the op.
    This above algorithm could be justified by observing side effects. While
    we traverse the graph in forwards direction, only latter nodes could view
    side effects of the current node. If the current node is not used later as
    well as no view of this node is used later in the graph, then it is safe to
    inplace as there would be no way to observe the side effects.
    This condition is slightly different for graph inputs where they can only
    be inplaced if the above condition is true and there's a copy_ in the
    epilogue that signals that the caller wants to observe the mutation.

    Unlike JIT Inductor, AOTInductor currently unlifts weights and buffers from
    input args, so instead of checking mutation on placeholder, AOTInductor
    checks mutation on get_attr. This is subject to change in future.
